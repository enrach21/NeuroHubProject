# Fig3:  Identifying transcription factors driving epigenomic changes between vRG and oRG.
Scripts involved in the creation of figure three.

### Fig3a: 
- Volcano plot of DEG
    - DARs used in this analysis are called [here](/loc/DAR)
### Fig3bc:
- Tobias Motif binding differences
    - "diffTFBS_oRG_vRG_bindetect_results"
    - "Motif required to have greater than 10 rpkm"
- Heat map of significant TFs matched with the change in expression
### Fig3d:
- LHX2 network created with cytoscpape highlighting DEGs regulated by LHX2 binding sites
### Fig3e:
- Expression of all targets of the 126 LHX2 motifs predcited to be more bound in oRG
